Shoebill
========

A Macintosh II emulator that runs A/UX (and A/UX only). 

Shoebill is an all-new, BSD-licensed Macintosh II emulator designed from the ground up with the singular goal of running A/UX. 

A/UX 1.x.x through 2.0.0 are supported currently, and 3.x.x support is in progress.

Shoebill requires a OS X, a Macintosh II or IIx ROM, a disk image with A/UX installed, and an A/UX kernel.
